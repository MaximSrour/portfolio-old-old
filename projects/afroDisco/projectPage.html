                        <p>The gameplay of Afro Disco is unlike what you might see in a strategy game or in a 'dance' game. It revolves around setting your dancers up in specific permutiations to perform dance moves (hence the Bejeweled analogy) that shove your opponents from the dance board. Some dance moves require you to use your lead dancer to 'take lead' and therefore require more setup to perform with a greater reward. Some moves push, move moves pull, some moves shuffle and some moves throw dancers, and the whole goal of the game is to eliminate either 3 out of 5 dancers or shove your opponents lead dancer off the dance floor.</p><p>Afro Disco started as a University project among friends for one of our game design classes. Given the whole semester to make a game, we began work immediately creating this disco dance game. The idea for the name comes from the fact that two of our members have afros and as a result of game design classes prior.</p><p>My role in the group is as the project manager and the lead artist. All of the art assets were created by me except for the character models as that is one of my weaknesses in modeling.</p><p>The game is currently set for release on the 15th of February 2018, though after that date we will likely continue to keep working on the game throughout the year providing free updates and dlc. Currently the game is set to only make a debut on Android but perhaps we will aim to get dev rights on iOS and even release on steam some day.</p>

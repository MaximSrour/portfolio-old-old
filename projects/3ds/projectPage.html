                        <p>My first creation in Maya, the 3DS was my way of experimenting with creating objects in Maya and working with textures and lighting techniques.</p>

                            <li><img class="icon iconMaya">TEMP</li>

                        <p>As my first attempt in 3D modelling in Maya, I was challenged by the modelling process because of how different it is so how it might be done in Fusion360 or in other CAD software (which is where all of my experience came from prior). Because this was a part of an assignment in one of my university classes, I spent a lot of time and attention on the finer detail, trying to really make it seem as though this could pass as promotional material for the offical 3DS.</p><p>One of my major focuses was on the lights and specifically trying to make them seem as though they are legitimate lights in the renders. It took a lot of trial and error and plenty of time just trying to figure out how to get these things working in a new program, but eventually I think I got it looking quite good. One of my primary struggles though were with text and other surface elements because at the time I had not yet learned how to UV map and propoerly texture, and therefore that entire segment was done quite crudely with small 3D meshes. If I were to redo this project, I would make sure to put time into making the UVs as well as possible so that there isn't any shearing on the textures.</p>

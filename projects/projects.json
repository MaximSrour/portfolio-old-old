				"The gameplay of Afro Disco is unlike what you might see in a strategy game or in a 'dance' game. It revolves around setting your dancers up in specific permutiations to perform dance moves (hence the Bejeweled analogy) that shove your opponents from the dance board. Some dance moves require you to use your lead dancer to 'take lead' and therefore require more setup to perform with a greater reward. Some moves push, move moves pull, some moves shuffle and some moves throw dancers, and the whole goal of the game is to eliminate either 3 out of 5 dancers or shove your opponents lead dancer off the dance floor.",
				"Afro Disco started as a University project among friends for one of our game design classes. Given the whole semester to make a game, we began work immediately creating this disco dance game. The idea for the name comes from the fact that two of our members have afros and as a result of game design classes prior.",

Currently the game is set to only make a debut on Android but perhaps we will aim to get dev rights on iOS and even release on steam some day."

It took a lot of trial and error and plenty of time just trying to figure out how to get these things working in a new program, but eventually I think I got it looking quite good. One of my primary struggles though were with text and other surface elements because at the time I had not yet learned how to UV map and propoerly texture, and therefore that entire segment was done quite crudely with small 3D meshes. If I were to redo this project, I would make sure to put time into making the UVs as well as possible so that there isn't any shearing on the textures."
